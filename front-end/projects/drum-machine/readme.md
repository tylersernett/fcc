Created as part of freecodecamp's curriculum.

Made using: Javascript, React

live demo: https://tylersernett.github.io/fcc/front-end/projects/drum-machine/index.html

Things learned: 
* add event listeners (for keypresses, etc) to the useEffect hook
* sample.currentTime = 0; allows for re-triggering (else, consecutive button presses won't work until the sample has run its full length).
